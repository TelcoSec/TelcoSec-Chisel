TelcoSec-Chisel is a free, bootable live Linux OS purpose-built for cellular security researchers, SDR engineers, and hardware pentesters. Based on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)** with a lightweight XFCE desktop, it ships with 48 pre-configured tools for SDR transceiver operation, 5G/4G core network simulation, baseband firmware emulation, SIM/eSIM auditing, and telecom protocol exploitation — ready to use without installation.

**Live boot credentials:** `telcosec` / `telcosec`

## What's Included

### Software Defined Radio (SDR)

Radio drivers are sandboxed in a dedicated Conda environment (`telcosec-sdr`) to isolate them from system Python and prevent ABI conflicts between hardware library versions.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **GNU Radio 3.10** | Primary DSP framework and flowchart design suite |
| **SoapySDR** | Vendor-neutral SDR hardware abstraction layer |
| **UHD (USRP Hardware Driver)** | Ettus Research USRP B210/X310 driver, compiled from source |
| **HackRF Host Tools** | HackRF One firmware, configuration, and RX/TX utilities |
| **gr-gsm** | GNU Radio blocks for receiving and decoding GSM air interfaces |
| **Kalibrate-RTL** | RTL-SDR local oscillator calibration against live GSM cells |
| **GQRX** | Spectrum analyzer and SDR receiver GUI |

**Supported hardware:** USRP B210, HackRF One, BladeRF 2.0 xA4, LimeSDR, RTL-SDR

### 5G / 4G RAN Simulation

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **srsRAN** | Open-source 4G eNB/5G gNB and UE RAN simulator |
| **Open5GS** | Complete 5G SA core (AMF, SMF, UPF, UDM, HSS) + 4G EPC |
| **UERANSIM** | 5G SA UE and gNB simulator; pre-configured for test PLMN 001/01 |
| **OAI UE** | OpenAirInterface 5G NR UE with full PHY/MAC/RLC stack |
| **srsUE** | Software UE for LTE attach procedure and downlink capture testing |
| **5Ghoul Fuzzer** | 5G NR baseband fuzzer over OAI rogue gNodeB (deferred compile) |

### Baseband & UE Analysis

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **FirmWire** | Samsung Shannon and MediaTek baseband emulation and fuzzing |
| **QCSuper** | Qualcomm DIAG USB protocol logger → PCAP (OTA messages) |
| **SCAT** | Qualcomm/Samsung modem diagnostic parser → PCAP with NAS/RRC |
| **MTKClient** | BROM bypass, partition editor, and flasher for MediaTek devices |
| **Balong-Flash** | Huawei Balong LTE modem firmware tool |
| **MobileInsight** | Android diagnostic log parser and analyzer |

### SIM & eSIM Auditing

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Osmocom SIMtrace 2** | ISO 7816 sniffer between modem and SIM card |
| **pySim-shell** | Interactive SIM/USIM management and scripting shell |
| **lpac** | eSIM Local Profile Assistant (GSMA SGP.22 LPA) |
| **pcscd** | PC/SC smartcard interface daemon |

### Signaling & Protocol Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Wireshark / TShark** | Custom profiles: GSMTAP, 5G NAS, Diameter, GTP column views |
| **SigPloit** | SS7, Diameter, and GTP exploitation framework |
| **Diafuzzer** | Orange Security Diameter fuzzer (S6a, Gx, Gy interfaces) |
| **sctpscan** | SCTP port scanner for SIGTRAN/S1AP/NGAP/Diameter endpoints |
| **SIPVicious** | SIP/VoIP auditing toolkit (svmap, svwar, svcrack) |
| **Scapy** | Packet crafting with M3UA, TCAP, MAP, and Diameter modules |
| **SIPp** | SIP load tester and traffic generator |

### Device Flashing & AT Tools

ADB, Fastboot, Heimdall (Samsung), EDL (Qualcomm 9008), Gammu, Minicom, AT Command Console, ModMobMap, LTESniffer, LTE-CellScanner

## OS Optimizations

TelcoSec-Chisel applies kernel-level tuning required by telecom tools out of the box:

- **Real-time scheduling** — PAM limits and `realtime` group allow GNU Radio and srsRAN threads to lock memory and run at SCHED_RR priority 99 (prevents RF sample drops)
- **SCTP stack tuning** — Pre-loaded `sctp` module; socket buffer sizes and RTO limits tuned for SIGTRAN/Diameter scanning
- **Low-latency USB** — udev rules disable autosuspend on USRP, HackRF, and BladeRF devices
- **Kernel security hardening** — ASLR, protected hardlinks/symlinks, dmesg restrictions, disabled ICMP redirects
- **Non-root hardware access** — `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-telcosec-hw.rules` maps USB IDs for HackRF, USRP, LimeSDR, BladeRF, and SIMtrace 2 to the `plugdev` group
- **UFW firewall** — Enabled by default; blocks incoming, allows outgoing

## Building the ISO

The build requires an Ubuntu or Debian host (or WSL2). Allow **30–60 minutes** and **~20 GB** free disk space.

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y debootstrap squashfs-tools grub-pc-bin grub-efi-amd64-bin xorriso mtools
```

### Build

```bash
sudo ./build-iso.sh
```

Output: `telcosec-chisel-live.iso`

### Build on Windows (WSL2)

```bash
wsl -d kali-linux -u root -- bash -c "cd //mnt//m//TelcoSec-Chisel && ./build-iso.sh"
```

### CI/CD

Every push to `main` triggers an automated build via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Tagged releases (`v*.*.*`) produce a GitHub Release with the ISO attached as a downloadable artifact.

## 5Ghoul — 5G NR Baseband Fuzzer

5Ghoul is not compiled during ISO build (OAI compilation takes 30+ minutes and would inflate the image). All build dependencies are pre-installed. On first use:

```bash
# USRP B210
sudo 5ghoul-install

# BladeRF 2.0 xA4
sudo 5ghoul-install --radio BLADERF
```

Then run a fuzzing attack:

```bash
sudo 5ghoul-run --Attack.Name=NAS_5GS_Fuzz
```

See the [5Ghoul setup guide](https://tschisel.telcosec.net/#fuzzer) for full configuration.
